# Todo-list
A to-do list application. Where user can add, remove or edit tasks. User can create projects and add tasks to projects. When user adds task, he can choose the project he wants to add task to, he can also choose the title, description, date and set the task priority. 

After clicking on each project name, user can see all the tasks that are in the project.

After clicking on the inbox user can see all the tasks.

By clicking on Today user can see the tasks that should be done today.

I also added local storage, so tasks and projects will be stored on user's computer.
